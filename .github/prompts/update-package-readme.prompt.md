description: Run this to update the README.md file for a ROS2 package.
agent: 'agent'

Locate the package.xml files in the current directory and identify ROS2 package directories. Update the README.md file for each package with the following information:
- Package name
- After package name, in italics 'This file is ai generated. Do not edit this file directly. Instead, edit the package files and run the update-readme command to update this file.'
- Package description (from package.xml)
- More detailed description of the package, including its purpose and functionality.
- List of nodes (if any) in the package with a brief description of each node (if available). Only include a node description, not detailed information about publishers, subscribers, services, actions, or parameters. That information should be in the documentation for each node, not in the package README.
- Authors (if any, omit if none)
- Maintainers (if any, omit if none)
- License information
- Any additional relevant information about the package.
- If the package contains any message files (files in a msg/ directory), include a section that lists these definitions with brief descriptions.
- If the package contains any service files (files in a srv/ directory), include a section that lists these definitions with brief descriptions.
- If the package contains any action files (files in a action/ directory), include a section that lists these definitions with brief descriptions.
- Only include sections for messages, services, or actions if the package actually contains definitions of that type. Do not include empty sections or sections with "None". Omit the entire section if there are no items of that type.
- If the package contains any documentation files (e.g., in a doc/ directory), include a section that lists these documentation files with brief descriptions and links to the files.
- If the package has any dependencies, include a section that lists these dependencies with brief descriptions and links to their documentation if available. Only include dependencies for packages that appear to be meta packages, that is they have no .msg, .srv, or .action definitions and they have no *.c, *.cpp, or *.py files.

If the README.md file already exists and it contains the text 'ai generated', review it and update the information as needed. If there are any sections that are missing or incomplete, add the necessary information to ensure the README.md file is comprehensive and up-to-date.

If the README.md file does not contain the text 'ai generated', do not modify it.
